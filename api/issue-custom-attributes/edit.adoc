To edit issue custom attributes send a PUT or a PATCH specifying the issue custom attribute id in the url.
In a PATCH request you just need to send the modified data, in a PUT one the whole object must be sent.

[source,bash]
----
curl -X PATCH \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  -d '{
          "name": "Duration"
      }' \
  https://api.taiga.io/api/v1/issue-custom-attributes/1
----

When the update is successful, the HTTP response is a 200 OK and the response body is a JSON link:#object-issue-custom-attribute-detail[issue custom attribute detail object]
