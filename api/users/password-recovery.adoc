To request a user password recovery send a POST with the following data

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST \
  -d '{
          "username": "'${USERNAME_OR_EMAIL}'"
      }' \
  https://api.taiga.io/api/v1/users/password_recovery
----

When the password recovery request succeeded, the HTTP response is a 200 OK and the response body is a JSON object:

[source, json]
----
{
    "detail": "Mail sended successfully!",
    "email": "${USER_EMAIL}"
}
----
