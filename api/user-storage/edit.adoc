To edit user storage data send a PUT or a PATCH specifying the user storage key in the url.
In a PATCH request you just need to send the modified data, in a PUT one the whole object must be sent.

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  -d '{
          "value": "Russian Taiga"
      }' \
