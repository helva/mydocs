To edit projects send a PUT or a PATCH specifying the project id in the url. In a PATCH request you just need to send the modified data, in a PUT one the whole object must be sent.

[source,bash]

curl -X PUT \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  -d '{
          "name": "Beta project put",
          "description": "Beta description"
      }' \
