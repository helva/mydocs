To edit user story attachments send a PUT or a PATCH specifying the user story attachment id in the url.
In a PATCH request you just need to send the modified data, in a PUT one the whole object must be sent.

[source,bash]
----
curl -X PATCH \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  -F "description=patching description" \
  https://api.taiga.io/api/v1/userstories/attachments/417
----

When the creation is successful, the HTTP response is a 200 OK and the response body is a JSON link:#object-attachment-detail[attachment detail object]
