To edit wiki pages send a PUT or a PATCH specifying the wiki page id in the url.
In a PATCH request you just need to send the modified data, in a PUT one the whole object must be sent.

[source,bash]

curl -X PATCH \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  -d '{
          "subject": "Patching subject"
      }' \
