To edit severities send a PUT or a PATCH specifying the severity id in the url.
In a PATCH request you just need to send the modified data, in a PUT one the whole object must be sent.

[source,bash]
----
curl -X PATCH \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  -d '{
          "name": "Patch name"
      }' \

When the creation is successful, the HTTP response is a 200 OK and the response body is a JSON link:#object-severity-detail[severity detail object]
