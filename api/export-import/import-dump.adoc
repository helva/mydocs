To load a project dump send a POST request with the following file:

- *dump* (required)

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  -F 'dump=@my-dump-file.json' \
  https://api.taiga.io/api/v1/importer/load_dump

Depending on server configuration it can return two results:

* A 202 Accepted and as response body a JSON of link:#object-import-accepted[import request accepted].
* A 201 Created and the response body is a JSON of link:#object-project-detail[project detail object]
