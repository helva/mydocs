Taiga Documentation
===================
:toc: left
:numbered:


Introduction
------------

Free. Open Source. Powerful. _Taiga_ is a project management platform for startups
and agile developers & designers who want a simple, beautiful tool that makes work
truly enjoyable.


Project Maturity
----------------

Because _Taiga_ is still a young project we currently consider it to be in a beta state.


API
---
_Taiga_ has a complete REST API (the one used by the web app), check the full API
documentation link:api.html[here].


How it Works
------------

_Taiga_ is made up of two components: link:https://github.com/taigaio/taiga-front[taiga-front]
and link:https://github.com/taigaio/taiga-back[taiga-back]

- *taiga-front* has the frontend related code built with *angularjs* and *coffescript*.
  It can run on any static file server like nginx.
- *taiga-back* has the backend related code consisting of an API, built using *django*
  and *python3*.

_Taiga_ has some other modules, but they are optional and documented in other sections.


Requirements
------------

This is a list of major _Taiga_ dependencies:

Runtime:

- Python 3.4
- PostgreSQL >= 9.3
- RabbitMQ (optional as long as you don't want async notifications)

Compile time:

- GCC & Development Headers
- Ruby 2.1 (only for compiling sass)
- NodeJS 0.10 (with npm, gulp and bower for downloading dependencies and compiling coffeescript)

Hardware

- The main Taiga hardware restriction is having **at least 0.75 GB of RAM memory**. When installing the python requirements the package lxml will use gcc for building it and fail if not enough memory.

Installation Guide
------------------

This section details everything you need to know to get _Taiga_ up and running
in both development and production environments.

=== Setup Production Environment

link:setup-production.html[This document contains the complete, step by step tutorial] of how
to properly setup _Taiga_ for a low traffic production environment.

=== Setup Development Environment

You can view the complete documentation on how to link:setup-development.html[setup a proper
development environment].

=== Other Ways to Setup an Initial Environment

In addition to the traditional step-by-step manuals, _Taiga_ comes with a
collection of provisioning scripts and Vagrant support, and
link:setup-alternatives.html[complete documentation of how to use them].


How to Contribute
-----------------

Because _Taiga_ is an open source project, we gratefully accept contributions in various forms.

Examples of contributions include:

- Code patches
- link:#contrib-plugins[Code contrib plugins]
- Improvements
- Bug reports
- Patch reviews

Before starting to develop a big feature (intended to be included on the _Taiga_ code base), it is
strongly recommended that you reach out to us on the link:http://groups.google.com/d/forum/taigaio[mailing list].

Reporting Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before reporting a bug or requesting a new feature, please consider these general points:

- Check that someone hasn't already filed the bug or feature request by searching, or running custom
  queries in, the ticket tracker.
- Check the right repository to use for reporting an issue: bugs related to UI should go to *taiga-front*,
  but if something is broken on the backend, an issue should be opened on the *taiga-back* repository.
- Ask on the link:http://groups.google.com/d/forum/taigaio[mailing list] first if you're not sure if
  what you're seeing is a bug.
- Don't use the GitHub issues system to ask support questions. Use the
  link:http://groups.google.com/d/forum/taigaio[mailing list] for that.
- Donâ€™t use GitHub issues for lengthy discussions, because they're likely to get lost. If a particular
  ticket is controversial, please move the discussion to the
  link:http://groups.google.com/d/forum/taigaio[mailing list].
